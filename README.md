<ul>
<li>With the onset of COVID-19 the entire world was in panic and the number of people being affected by the deadly virus were increasing day by day.</li>
<li>In these tough times everyone was finding a cure to this virus and Plasma therapy was a ray of hope to many.But the lack of a centralized platform for plasma donors in case of emergency were tough to find.</li>
<li>Thus our team of students decided to step up and create a platform to bridge the gap.</li>
<p>Our entire project is divided into 3 parts-</p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Plasma Donor</strong>-The plasma donors are the patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have thus developed antibodies.We take the details of these volunteers and save it into our database so that any patient in the donor's proximity could be helped.We also provide each of the parties with a tracking ID so that they could keep track of their application.</li>
<li><strong>Patient</strong>-On the patient side we made a application form which requires minimal information.Once our backend code verifies the legitimacy of both the donor and the patient the location given by the patient is checked and we search the closest patient available in that proximity(firstly in same area--->then in same city---->same state) and then match the donor and the patient.On successful match and background chehk we share both parties the details of each other via the dashboard as well as whatsapp.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking</strong>-Each donor and patient are provided with a tracking ID via which they can teack their application.</li>
</ol>

<h3 align="center">Unique Features</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>-We have kept the product as simple as possible by maintaing a simple and easy to use UI/UX design to simple and efficient backend algorithms.This not only decreses the server load and runtime but also makes the application usable for all the age groups.This is the main feature which would also help us scale in future if we want uniformity in our medical system.</li>
<li><strong>Verification of the patient and donor</strong>-Any users who registered on our website are thoroughly checked so that there are no issue like corrupt practices,just for fun activities from the donor side and also false patients and misuse of plasma via patients.This helps us maintain a hoghly secure network(verification done via medical slip and direct contact).</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>-The tracking algorithm we have used is on the basis of area, then on the basis of city and lastly on the basis of state.Thus we take care that the patient recieves the closest destination which would also be convinient for the donoe</li>
<li><strong>Tracking</strong>-Each donor and patient are provided with a tracking ID via which they can teack their application.</li>
<li><strong>Data Security</strong>-The entire database is managed in a very effcient manner with our main focus on data hiding and prevention of data leaks.All the passwords and digital documents on the site have been encrypted so that there is data security in case of any data leak.</li>
